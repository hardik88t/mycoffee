## üìä Project Manager Integration Log

### Task Completion Tracking
**Track when you complete tasks from Project Manager**

- **2025-01-17**: Completed "Project Documentation Setup" - Created comprehensive README, DEV, PLAN, and DEVLOG files
- **2025-01-17**: Completed "Tech Stack Decision" - Finalized HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JS with Tailwind CSS approach
- **2025-01-17**: Completed "Project Architecture Planning" - Defined 6-page website structure and feature roadmap

### Database Queries Used
**Document useful SQL queries for My Coffee project**

```bash
# Get current high-priority tasks for My Coffee project
sqlite3 $PROJECT_MANAGER_DB "
  SELECT name, type, status, priority, description
  FROM ProjectItem pi
  JOIN Project p ON pi.projectId = p.id
  WHERE p.name = 'My Coffee'
  AND pi.priority IN ('HIGH', 'URGENT')
  AND pi.status = 'TODO';
"

# Update task status to completed
sqlite3 $PROJECT_MANAGER_DB "
  UPDATE ProjectItem
  SET status='COMPLETED', updatedAt=datetime('now')
  WHERE name='Documentation Setup'
  AND projectId=(SELECT id FROM Project WHERE name='My Coffee');
"

# Add new development task
sqlite3 $PROJECT_MANAGER_DB "
  INSERT INTO ProjectItem (id, projectId, name, description, type, status, priority, labels, createdAt, updatedAt)
  VALUES (
    lower(hex(randomblob(16))),
    (SELECT id FROM Project WHERE name='My Coffee'),
    'HTML Structure Setup',
    'Create semantic HTML5 structure for all 6 pages',
    'TASK',
    'TODO',
    'HIGH',
    '[\"frontend\", \"html\"]',
    datetime('now'),
    datetime('now')
  );
"
